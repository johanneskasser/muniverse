We fixed the foot of the dominant leg (right in all participants) onto the pedal of a commercial dynamometer (OT Bioelettronica) positioned at 30 degree in the plantarflexion direction, 0 degree being the foot perpendicular to the shank. The thigh was fixed to the massage tablewith an inextensible 3-cm-wide Velcro strap. The foot was fixed to the pedal with inextensiblestraps positioned around the proximal phalanx, metatarsal and cuneiform. Force signals wererecorded with a load cell (CCT Transducer s.a.s.) connected in-series to the pedal using the sameacquisition system as for the HD-EMG recordings (EMG-Quattrocento; OT Bioelettronica). The dynamometer was positioned accordingly to the participant's lower limb length andsecured to the massage table to avoid any motion during the contractions.",
