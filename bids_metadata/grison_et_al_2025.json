        "EMGPlacementSchemeDescription": "Two grids were carefully positioned side-to-side with a 4-mm distance between the electrodes at the edges of adjacent grids. The 128 electrodes were centered to the muscle belly (right tibialis anterior) and laid  within the muscle perimeter identified through palpation. Two bands damped with water were placed around the ankle as ground (R2) and reference (R1) electrodes.",

        "SetUpDescription": "The participant sat on a chair with the hips flexed at 30 degree, 0 degree being the hip neutral position, and their knees fully extended. We fixed the foot of the dominant leg (right in all participants) onto the pedal of a commercial dynamometer (OT Bioelettronica) positioned at 30 degree in the plantarflexion direction, 0 degree being the foot perpendicular to the shank. The thigh was fixed to the chair with an inextensible 3-cm-wide Velcro strap. The foot was fixed to the pedal with inextensible straps positioned around the proximal phalanx, metatarsal and cuneiform. Force signals were recorded with a load cell (CCT Transducer s.a.s.) connected in-series to the pedal using the same acquisition system as for the HD-EMG recordings (EMG-Quattrocento; OT Bioelettronica). The dynamometer was positioned accordingly to the participant’s lower limb length and secured to the massage table to avoid any motion during the contractions.",

        "TaskDescription": "The participant performed one, two, or three trapezoidal contractions at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, and 70 percent MVC with 120 s of rest in between, consisting of linear ramps up and down performed at 5 percent per second and a plateau maintained for 20 s up to 30 percent MVC, 15 s for 35 percent and 40 percent MVC, and 10 s from 50 percent to 70 percent MVC. The order of the contractions was randomized.",
