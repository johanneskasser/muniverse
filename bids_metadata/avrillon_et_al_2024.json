The foot of the dominant leg (right in all participants) was fixed onto the pedal of an ankle dynamometer (OT Bioelettronica, Turin, Italy) positioned at 30° in the plantarflexion direction, 0° being the foot perpendicular to the shank. The thigh and the foot were fixed with inextensible Velcro straps. Force signals were recorded with a load cell (CCT Transducer s.a.s, Turin, Italy) connected in-series to the pedal using the same acquisition system as for the EMG recordings (EMG-Quattrocento; OT Bioelettronica, Italy).",
        "TaskDescription": "The experimental session began with a warm-up that consisted of submaximal isometric contractions from 50% to 80% of the subjective MVC. Then, participants performed two MVC with 2 min of rest in between. The maximal torque was considered as the highest torque value recorded over an average window of 250 ms. The rest of the session consisted of a series of eight submaximal isometric contractions performed at 10–80% of the MVC with 10% MVC increments. The pattern of the contractions followed a trapezoidal target displayed on a screen in real time with the force trace. Ramp-up and ramp-down phases were performed at a constant pace of 5% MVC/s. The force plateaus were maintained for either 10 s (70–80% MVC), 15 s (50–60% MVC), or 20 s (10–40% MVC). The contractions were separated by 90 s of rest and their order was randomised.",
