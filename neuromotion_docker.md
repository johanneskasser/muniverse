Notes
- neuromotion installation works seamlessly on linux machines
- will be easy to create a docker container I think.

Confirm whether neuromotion installation works (shihan-ma/Neuromotion.git)
- install conda env (works)
- download relevant data and place it where required
- run scripts

Confirm whether Irene's scripts can already be executed (less relevant at the moment, because her scripts are not already BIDS formatted, so they need to be modified anyway).
